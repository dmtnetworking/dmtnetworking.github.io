The events that ECU provides to its students is a crucial part of the ICTN degree.
"Resume Blitz!" events happen monthly, and students can get their resume critqued. These events are
crucial, because large companies visit campus on a regular basis. In addition, each semester there is a
large career fair at the Greenville Convention Center. The College of Engineering & Technology has it's own
career fair, due to the number of vendors that arrive. In addition, field trip options pop-up based on availability.

<p>
Your time at ECU will be a great one, but attending these events and subscribing to event feed pages can
help make your experience even more fruitful. Students who regularly attend events, and network, are usually
selected by employers during their time here.</p>
